# jenkins
Simple docker setup for Jenkins.

# Setup
open up your favourite command shell e.g. bash and navigate to this directory e.g. "cd /c/projects/jenkins"

run the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

Your instance of jenkins should then be viewable at: localhost:8080

The jenkins administrator password will be listed in your command shell.

Enjoy!
